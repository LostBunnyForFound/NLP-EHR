Analysing clinical semantic textual similarity on big data. 

Abstract: 
Clinical Semantic Textual Similarity (ClinicalSTS) measures the degree of similarity between two sentences. The key challenges of ClinicalSTS are how to extract medical concepts and identify templates. This project has leveraged three deep learning models, they are fully connected neural network, Attention-based CNN (ABCNN) and LSTM. The comparison between the three models has illustrated that even their accuracy is quite identical, each of them has its own strength and weakness. The comparison between embedding methods has shown the influence of embedding methods. After partially removed templates, the performance of ABCNN is improved, it proves the template is a distraction for deep learning models. 

After obtained three models, this project has illustrated why itâ€™s hard to do model selection when the dataset is small. The reason why building ensemble models are explained theoretically and intuitively. It has proposed two types of ensemble models, one is inspired from weighted voting, and another one is decision tree. Due to the relation within models, decision tree works better. 

Current three models are transplanted into a distributed system to cope with the big data challenge. This project has brought up two types of mechanism, one is data parallelism, and another is model parallelism. Data parallelism is deployed on Spark, model parallelism is on HPC (Spartan).
